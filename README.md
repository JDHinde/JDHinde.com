# JDHinde.com
A personal website housing a curriculum vitae and links to my various projects.

This project will incorporate ideas gathered from the w3schools.com webpage templates:
  Parallax (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_parallax.htm)
  CV (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_cv.htm)
  
Additionally, Codepen.io has provided countless ideas for useful web elements.

The framework I will be using to develope the basic css for JDHinde.com is provided by Bulma and W3schools.com.

I am uncertain about the extent to which I will explore custom javascript elements, apps, and animations. Furthermore, I will need to expand my knowledge of back-end coding and frameworks to get the site in working order.
